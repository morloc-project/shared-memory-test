Columns:
 * epoch - number of sets of tests that will be run
 * nloop - number of loops test
 * size - bytes allocated in each loop in this test (random between 0 and size)
 * efficiency - current allocated memory (including block headers) / sum of all volume sizes
 * talloc - time spent allocating / nloop
 * talloc_bytewise - time allocating / nloop / size / 2
 * tfree - time spent freeing / nloop
 * tfree_byte - time freeing / nloop / size / 2
